# AI-Generated Harvest Notes

*Comprehensive analysis of the Keith Williams / EverydayAI portfolio project*

## Project Overview & Purpose

### Core Mission
This portfolio represents a sophisticated approach to **AI education and community engagement**, built by Keith Williams, Director of Enterprise AI at NJIT. The site serves multiple audiences—students, employers, educators, and practitioners—with tailored content pathways addressing real AI workplace transformation.

### Strategic Positioning
The portfolio positions Keith as a **bridge-builder** between academic AI research and practical workplace implementation. Unlike typical AI content that focuses on hype or fear, this site provides nuanced, evidence-based perspectives on AI's actual impact on jobs, education, and society.
